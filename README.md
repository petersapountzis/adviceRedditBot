I followed along with a YouTube video to get this code.

It works by going to a selected subreddit, and scans the top 5 hot posts. 
From there, it looks for comments with a certain keyword, in this case "stressed" and responds to them with one of the few sad quotes that I found on the website (https://www.keepinspiring.me/quotes-about-sadness/)
